# Spider2
A new board design for the amazing [COATI Spider project](https://coati.pimienta.org/electronics/spider/), a small portable device for simultaneous interpretation.

# Redesign Goals
- way less noise
    * avoid interferences from radios and other channel
    * balanced microphone inputs
    * filtered power from AC power supply
    * PCB with a groundplane for less
- Modern and better available components
- Some battery level indicator
- better gain control range
- In-place replacement in the same case

# Status
First prototype in development. Parts are ordered probably built end of April

# Outlook
- Around 50€ for a new spider and 20€ for an upgrade board (reusing some of the old parts)
- Probably only one new cutout in the case to be made for an upgrade (-> USB-C Port for charging/powerbank ♥)
- At least double the battery runtime
- There should be no noticeable noise at all :) (when used with an XLR to stereo jack microphone cable for "balanced" audio)
- A few components are more difficult to solder ("SMD"), as many modern chips are no longer available in large size ("trough hole")
